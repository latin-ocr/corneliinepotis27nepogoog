Cicero, Atticus and Catullus. He was probably a native of
Verona, or of some neighboring village, and died during the reign
ol Augustus. His praenomenisunknown. He filled noneof tho
· higher offices of governmcnt, but seems to have devoted himself
exclusively to a literary life, and to the society of that learned
circle which made the house of Atticus its centra. No other
particulare with regard to his personal history have been trans·
mitted to us. He is known to have written the following works:
notantes. An Epitome of Universal History, in three books.
2. Eaemphrum Lttrt. This was probably a collection of remark·
able sayings and doings. 3. DcIllastcihna Viris Gellius tells us
an anecdota of Cato, adding, “Scriptum est hoc in libro Cornelii
Nepotis De [destribuit Vacisl' Thefirstand second of these works
have perished. With regard to the third, various opinions have
been entertained. By some it is regarded as one of the lost works
ol Nepos, and as forming no part of the work now known as Cor·
nelius Nepos. But that opinion now generally prevails which
regards the Da Illastnibns Vinia as by sar the largest and most
important work of Nepos, of which only fragmentary portione
have come down to us; those portione, namely‚ which are included
in the present volume. This work contained in at least six·
teen books the lives of eminent men, arranged in classes, in
such a manner, that eminent foreigners of one class were pre-
sented in one book, and eminent Romans of the same class in the
following book. The arrangement was probably as follows:
I. De Regibus Enternram gentium II. Da nepita Romanurnnt;
ΙΙΙ. De Excellentibns Ducibus blateronem gentium IV. Da Encel-
lentibns Ducibus Romanorum ; V. Dc Jnra &multia oruata: VI·
DsJurt'a (bnsultia Romonie; Vll. De osannae 02·aeeu;V111.
