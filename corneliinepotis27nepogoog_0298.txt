The present work is the result oi an effort to produce an Ele·
. mentary Algebra suited to the wants os classes commencing the
study. It has been prepared by one who sor years has felt the

need ot' just such a book, and is the sruit os long experience
in the school-room.

With this book in hand, the pupil cannot help avoiding the

difficulties which invariably present themselves at the very
threshold ol the study of Algebra.
It has been the aim tn give such a presentation oi the subject
pas will meet the wants oi Common Schools and Academies. It
is an elementary work, and uo attempt has been made to include
everything which might be brought under the head ol Algebra.
The treatment oi the subJect is on the principle of “step by
step,'’ so that the pupil at the very outset is inspired with a de-
grecos confidence which induces sels-reliance; rendering un·
necessary a constant application to the teacher for help.
The book is commended to teachers in the hope that it wi'd

, satissy a need which the author has himself frequently selt.
