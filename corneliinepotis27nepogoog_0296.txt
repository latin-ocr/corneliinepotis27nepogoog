’ Ιτοοῐιι, and for years past has made a specialty of the subject of
which the present volume treats. ¹ The great variety and copious·

Eart'r lanunl ot American Literature is a companion volume
to the “English Literature‚” with which it corresponds in
general character and design. It is intended as a text-book for
Colleges, and as a book of reference. t

In these volumes Prof. Hart has embodied the matured fruits
of his life-long studies in this department of letters. We believe
they will he found in advance of any other text-books on the
subject, in the comprehensiveness of the plan, the freshness of
much of the materials, the sonnd judgment shown in the critical
opinions, the clearness with which the several topics are pre·
sented, and the benuty as well as the practica] convenience of the
mechanical arrangements.

The scholarly culture and excellent literary judgrnent dis· Ι
played‚ entitle these books to a high place among the works on
English literature. The plan and arrangement present many
novel features, and the thoroughness of detail, brevity and pre-
cision of statement, elegance of style, and soundness of opinion
which characterize the volumes, call for the sincerest commen·
dation.
