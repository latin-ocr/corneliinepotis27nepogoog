ing to this view, it will be seen that we possess, exclusive of very
inconsiderable fragments, only t-he third book entire, portioris
of the first and twelsth, and a Life οἰ Atticus, to whom the

‚ whole work was dedicated. The Life of Atticus was added aster

his death, and alter the first publication of the work.

Nepos was not a man of vast and comprehensive mind, like
Cicero or Caesar, but he was evidently a man of rare culture,
kindly heart, and genial disposition. A pure Latinity, an easy
elegauce, and an unaffeoted simplicity characterize aud adoru his
style. These qualities have made Nepos a lavorite school-book
since 1471, the date of his first modern publication. In that year
a quarto volume issued from the press oi Jenson, at Venice,
entitled Aemilii Probi da Vita Bccdlentium, containing biogra-
phies oi twenty distinguished commanders, three chapters
lreadcd Do Reyibas, and biographies of Hamilcar and Ean-
nibal. This edition was followed by several others, with the
same general title, in all of which Ptobus appeared to be the
author; and it was not until 1569, that Dionysius Lambinus pub·

lished a carcfully revised edition, and proved to the general
satisfaction os the learned that the whole work was the produc-

tion of Cornelius Nepos, and that Aemilius Probus had fraudu·
lently endeavored to palm it off as his own. The argument oi
Lambinus is based chiefly on internal evidence, and his judgment
has been reaffirmed by thescholars oi more modern times, Ocra·
pilari from coriam sources.
