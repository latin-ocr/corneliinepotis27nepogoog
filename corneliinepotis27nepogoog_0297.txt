The study ol Physiology and the Laws of Health is as impor-
tantas it is interesting. Its importance has become so generally
l recognized that there are now few schools in which it does not
occupy a prominent position in the course oi instruction. Dr.
Martindale’s Anatomy, Physiology, and Hygiene presents the
following claims to the consideration of teachers. Technicalities
have been avoided, so sar as consistent with the'treatment of the
subject. The style in which it is written is not only pleasing,
but such as to be readily comprehended by those for whose use
it is designed. Superduons matter has been omitted, so that
the book can be completed in a much shorter period than any
other text-book on the subject as yet published.

ΡΗΥ, ἙοτΒεςίῐιῃεῐε. By Josurrr C. Maurin-
DALE, M.D., late Principal of the Madison Gram-
mar School. Price by mail, postpaid, 60 cents.

This bools is what its title indicates, “ First Lessons in Natural
Philosophy, '³ and it presents each division os the subject in such
an easy and familiar style, that it cannot sail to interest and in·
struet any child of ordinary intelligence. Beginning as it does
in a simple and easy manner, it secures the interest of the pupil
by first directing his attention to objects ln nature with which he
issamiliar. When the interest is thus excited, the subject is
gradually unlolded by presenting, one after another, the familiar
things met with in the every-day wallis ol life; thus, the most
common objects are made the means of teaching great philo-
sophical truths. Only so mnch ol the subject is presented as can
be taught with profit in our public and private schoOIS, yet what
has been given will be found to embrace all the more common
phenomena met with in every-day lif . The laets are so clearly
and so plainly set forth, that they are entirely capable os com·

prehension by those sor whose use and benefit this little-work is
designed.
