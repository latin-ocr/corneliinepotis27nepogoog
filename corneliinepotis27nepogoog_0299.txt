ln every High School and Academy in the land, the organiza-
tion of a class in Commercial Arithmetic, Business Calculations
and Forms, will prove an clement of popularity and success that
will yield rich results. The subject itsels is so intrinsically valu-
able as a means of developing thought, that, were this the only
result to be gained, it would be entitled to and should re‘ceive
the special attention ol the progressive teacher. But apart from
this, the introduction ol a study so interesting in itself, so attrac-
tive to the scholar, and having so direct a bearing on his future
welsare, will, in many an instance, decide lhe welsare oi a school,
directing the channel oi popular opinion in its lavor, and prove the
means oi filling it with students anxious to secure ils advantages.
Circulars containing full descriptive notice, testimonials, διο,
