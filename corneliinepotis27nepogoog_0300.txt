'ibe compilet cannot¹ conceal the hope that this glimpse of
our general literature may tempt to individual research among
its treasures, so varied and inexhaustible; -that this text-book·
for the school-room may become not only teacher, but fn'end, to
those in whose hands it is placed, and while aiding, through
systematic development and training of the elocutionary powers ,
of the pupil, to overcome many of the practical difficulties of
instruction, may accomplish a higher work in the cultivation
and refinement of character.

’ Great carebas been taken to consult the authorized editions
of the various writers represented, that the extracts from their
works may be relied upon as accurate; though, in some instances,
preference has been given to an early edition, when, in later
issues, the alterations have not been deemed improvements.
Many poenis have been introduced which have never before
found their way into any book of selections, being now for the
first time published in this country in a permanent form.

’ Itis believed that this book will be found adrnirably adapted for
use as a ‘⁴ Reader,’' either in connection with any of the regular
series of reading-books, or to be taken up by classes that, having
used the higher readers of the different series, need variety as an

· incentive to interest. For thispurpose we particularly commend

it to the attention of Principals of AcademieS‚ Seminaries, High
Schools, Norrnal Schools, and Institutions for lloung Ladies.
