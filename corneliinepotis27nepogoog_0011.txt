difficulties. The Notes have been prepared with this ob-
ject in view. The assistance which is ungrudgingly offered
in other departments of learning should not be refused
in astudy admirable for its severity. Hence, translations
of difficult passages are given, as well as of single words,
generally the pivots on which the sense of sentences turns.

The translations are as nearly literal as was consistent '

with correctness or with difference of idiom. With all
the aid thus given, enough still remains both to tax the
industry of the student and to keep his intellectual fac-
ulties in a wholesome state of tension.

The Lexicon has been prepared especially for the ac·
ccmpanying text, and by constant reference to it. It
contains the meaning of every word as used by N epos; ⁴
and occasionally an additional definition or two are given,
in order to show more clearly the general meaning of a ,

word. The quantity of all syllables not evident by in· “

spection has been marked in the usual way.

The chronological table, from Koch, in very easy Latin,
presente a condensed view of the whole work of Nepos,
and by focalizing the time, the place, the character, and
the circumstance, may not unfrequently resolve a doubt
on the part of the student, and otherwise prove of essen-
tial service to him.
