ΤΗΕ most recent recension of the text of Nepos ie that
of Koch, from the Tauchnitz prese. This recension,

. the result of a painetaking collation of tho most trust·

, worthy manuscripts, by one of Germany'e beet scholare,

Stoddard, Harkness‚ Bullions and Morris, Allen, Allen
and Greenongh, and Gildersleeve3 with occasional refer·

giving him aid sufficient to enable him to surmount ench
